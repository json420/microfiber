Description: fabric for a lightweight Couch
 Microfiber is an abstract adapter for making HTTP requests to an arbitrary JSON
 loving REST API like CouchDB.  Rather than wrapping the API in a bunch of
 one-off methods, Microfiber just makes it super easy to call any part of the
 CouchDB REST API, current or future.  This approach allows Microfiber to be
 very simple and basically maintenance free as it requires no changes to support
 new additions to the CouchDB API.
